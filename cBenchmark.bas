'About the chosen datatype: The fastest possible way (as in with least amount of overhead)
'to store qpc stamps is to store them in an array as datatype Currency (or as LongLong).
'Storing the stamps as a UDT (fe LARGE_INTEGER.lowpart and .highpart) takes much longer,
'as basically two 'seperate' primary datavalues have to be stored. Surprisingly there is no difference
'in time at all in using either LongLong or Currency, however, datatype LongLong is not availabe
'on 32-bit machines. Reverting of Currency-returns is required, but that is done after benchmarking
'finished so it will not effect the benchmark results.

'used definitions:
'QPC            QueryPerformanceCounter, reads the TSC and translates it to a timeunit
'stamp          returnvalue from QPC, which is an accurate time-stamp since computer has been boot
'QPF            QueryPerformanceFrequency
'frequency      the amount of QPC-cycles per second, nowadays usually 10MHz on Windows 10 but can differ per machine
'tic            difference between two QPC time stamps
'cpu-cycle      a single increment of the CPU clock during which the smallest unit of processor activity is carried out.
'qpc-cycle      non-exisiting term that just shows how confusing clock cycles are.
'RDTSC          Read Time Stamp Counter, an even more accurate way to benchmark code, but for VBA it would require a custom made .dll
